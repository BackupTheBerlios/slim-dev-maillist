Subject: [Slim-dev] [Bug #19262] Slim ending up in black screen with Nvidia
	Optimus
Message-ID: <201401271645.s0RGjdob001223@www.berlios.de>

Bug #19262, was updated on 2014-Jan-27 17:45

Summary: Slim ending up in black screen with Nvidia Optimus

Details: 1. Set up optimus with 'nvidia' & 'modesetting' drivers
2. Boot
3. black screen appears, input works, login works (blind)
4. normal x session works

How to solve:
The commands 
'xrandr --setprovideroutputsource modesetting NVIDIA-0'
'xrandr --auto'

are needed in the .xinitrc, but this is executed AFTER slim. So if slim would allow a script that is executed BEFORE itself to configure the x-server, we could fix this.

HW:
Thinkpad T420s
Intel HD Graphics & Nvidia N4200

OS:
Linux 3.12.9-1-ARCH

Could you email me further details of your setup?  I have a W520 which contains the same Nvidia Optimus, and I do not have this "blanking" issue...  axs at gentoo.org
