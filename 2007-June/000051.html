I'm currently waiting for some feedback from Tobias Roth, the current
maintainer from the freebsd port. He kindly accepted to give the slim-pam
branch a shot when he's back from his vacation (this week).

On a related note, I'll be on vacation from today afternoon until
Jul 10; I should be able to handle email, not sure about svn access.
Feel free to merge slim-pam with trunk and put out a release if
appropriate. 

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; meanwhile, do you think we need to include a sample /etc/pam.d/slim?

Fine, we'll add a sample config file and install it by default if
USE_PAM is enabled.

&gt;<i> It should be noted that this is a problem in PAM and NOT in slim. I have

</I>
On NetBSD things appeared to work even without a configuration
file, I suspect this is Linux-PAM specific; let me know if there's some
related test you'd like to see on NetBSD.

Regards,
Simone
