<PRE>Hi,

&gt;&gt;<i> How are we doing on the 1.3.0 release?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, I've been lacking some time to test the latest slim-pam
</I>&gt;<i> commits on netbsd. 
</I>
No problem.

&gt;<i> I'm currently installing a few packages via pkgsrc in order to
</I>&gt;<i> be able to work / commit from netbsd, but the process is painfully slow
</I>&gt;<i> since netbsd doesn't play well with the kqemu accelerator (or the other
</I>&gt;<i> way around).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll try to complete the tests later doday;
</I>
Sounds good. I didn't want to put too much pressure on you. We all do
this in our precious free time. However IF the release gets further
delayed (which is OK if the people doing the final testing don't have
time) then could we please consider reopening the development on the
1.3.0 branch? I'm waiting for something to do ^_^.

&gt;<i> meanwhile, do you think we need to include a sample /etc/pam.d/slim?
</I>
It's probably a good idea, but I don't think we should put too much work
into it. It's probably one of the things that the distros will modify to
their liking anyway. I've attached my own slim-configuration for
reference. It's using the Linux-PAM syntax, the Gentoo PAM-layout and
then I've added the use of the pam_usb PAM-module. Maybe we could
include something as simple as this, perhaps without the pam_usb
support. However I think most distros will modify this anyway, so it
should only be a sample file.

Cheers,
