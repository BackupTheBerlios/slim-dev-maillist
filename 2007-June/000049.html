<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I think we should wait before pushing additional changes and release
</I>&gt;<i> 1.3.0 asap. Then we can work on the 1.3.x series, hopefully with some
</I>&gt;<i> feedback from the users.
</I>
What the status on the release?

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> meanwhile, do you think we need to include a sample /etc/pam.d/slim?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's probably a good idea, but I don't think we should put too much work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into it. It's probably one of the things that the distros will modify to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their liking anyway. I've attached my own slim-configuration for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reference. It's using the Linux-PAM syntax, the Gentoo PAM-layout and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then I've added the use of the pam_usb PAM-module. Maybe we could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> include something as simple as this, perhaps without the pam_usb
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support. However I think most distros will modify this anyway, so it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should only be a sample file.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds good, we'll simply add a paragraph to the current documentation
</I>&gt;<i> pointing to the sample file.
</I>
After doing some more testing myself I discovered that slim going
bananas if the PAM configuration is missing. The problem is that PAMs
default policy is to fail any authentication attempt if the requested
service is unconfigured however the applications using PAM is not given
any reason for the failure. So if the slim service is unconfigured slim
ends up in a rather nasty (and loud, if you have PC-speaker) loop.
So we DO need to include a configuration file.

It should be noted that this is a problem in PAM and NOT in slim. I have
a few ideas for fixes but I'll rather wait until after the 1.3.0 release
as I need to double check a few things with OpenPAM as well. I don't
consider it a show-stopper for the 1.3.0 release but it is something we
should be aware of if someone complaints about this behaviour.

Cheers,
