I think we should wait before pushing additional changes and release
1.3.0 asap. Then we can work on the 1.3.x series, hopefully with some
feedback from the users.

Back on the netbsd tests:
- Fixed a libpam-only include (r138)
- replaced x_strdup with plain strdup (r139) since it's only available
  in libpam. We may as well find a more elegant solution to this.

Other than that, the pam-aware slim seems to work properly on
my test image.

&gt;<i> &gt; meanwhile, do you think we need to include a sample /etc/pam.d/slim?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's probably a good idea, but I don't think we should put too much work

</I>&gt;<i> then I've added the use of the pam_usb PAM-module. Maybe we could

</I>&gt;<i> support. However I think most distros will modify this anyway, so it
</I>&gt;<i> should only be a sample file.
</I>
Sounds good, we'll simply add a paragraph to the current documentation
pointing to the sample file.

I'll likely contact the slim port maintainer for freebsd to see if
he's interested in checking out the pam branch. If no other issues
arise, I think it's time to putting together the boring part of
doc updates ;-)

Regards,
Simone
