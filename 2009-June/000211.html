<PRE>Hi everyone,
I'm using slim for a couple of months and would like to contribute to
its development. Thus I'd like to play around a little bit with the
code. I know c/c++ programming but i would present myself as a
experienced programmer and I'm far from understanding how the xserver,
the login manger, the desktop environment or window manager play
together.
I downloaded the slim-1.3.1.tar and tried to compile.
In ./switchuser.cpp a 

#include &lt;cstdio&gt;

is missing in order to have remove() available (line 59).
OK then, I could compile the code. Now my problems begin: How do I test
the executable? Since I have slim already running in the background, it
locks another instance. I tried just to comment out the lock stuff, but
it would exit my window manager and just drop me to my old slim login
like after a normal restart. I also had the feeling, my new executable
is using my own slim theme even though I changed the path to the
slim.conf.
This is probably a noob question, but could you folks just tell me how
you're testing slim?


Thanks a lot
Rolf
