<PRE>Bug #16020, was updated on 2009-Jul-21 17:01

Summary: Delete screenshot before taking a new

Details: When taking a screenshot, it overwrites the existing file. To avoid that it is possible to first unlink the file. The reason is that it could be a symlink, and allowing saving the screenshot to /tmp/slim.png, anyone could log in and corrupt any file he wishes.

Comment:
Slim runs as root and is able to corrupt the file under the possible symlink. Anyone can create a symlink in tmp, also the reason why usually a subdirectory is created or a unique filename with tmpfile().

One can deliberately create the symlink /bin/sh f.e. and than logout and take a screenshot. That results in sh being overwritten by the PNG image.

Comment:
Usually in /tmp there are no symlinks especially not such a screenshot called slim.png. And files saved in /tmp can't be corrupted by another user, because files in /tmp are saved with the current user as the owner, his main group as the group and with the user's umask. And symlinks usually follow the file permissions of the file to which they point.

So if you really set a symlink called /tmp/slim.png which links to a file in e.g. your home directory, then you should set the file permissions to that file correctly, so that it can't be corrupted by another user. This should be done anyway.

If another user can corrupt the files in your home directory then you have a security problem anyway because of wrong file permissions.

So I don't think, that deleting a screenshot first is necessary.
