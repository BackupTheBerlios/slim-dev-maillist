Hey,

</I>
I partially agree. While there is little doubt that static casts are more
secure, I think it really makes sense when a piece of code becomes so
complicated that it's difficult to debug without some help from the
compiler.
That said, my only complain against C++ style casts is they're ugly
as hell to read, so I have no strong opinion on this.

&gt;<i> *) Switch from fork() to vfork() in app.cpp to avoid the memory
</I>&gt;<i>    overhead. vfork() is especially designed for the situation, when you
</I>&gt;<i>    combine fork() and exec() to execute another program. Using vfork()
</I>&gt;<i>    have a smaller overhead but requires that we are a bit careful about
</I>&gt;<i>    what we do in the child process. Of course we also need to check if
</I>&gt;<i>    vfork() is available on all supported platforms.
</I>&gt;<i>    (<A HREF="http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/ForkExecProcesses.html">http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/ForkExecProcesses.html</A>)
</I>
AFAIK it's available in all of the BSDs.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *) We do duplicate calculations of font extend in several places in
</I>&gt;<i>    panel.cpp. Either this should be done one time for all or, if
</I>&gt;<i>    necessary, the calculation should be properly encapsulated.
</I>
True; IMO a font class would be a step in the right direction,
so we can leave out the xft oddness from the main program logic.

&gt;<i> *) In Image::Merge() we merge a (small) panel image with a (big)
</I>&gt;<i>    background image by reallocation a new (big) image, copy data from
</I>&gt;<i>    the two images and then free the two original images (the panel image
</I>&gt;<i>    is freed in Image::Merge() and the background image is freed in
</I>&gt;<i>    Panel::Panel()). It would be faster (and probably easier) to simply
</I>&gt;<i>    draw the panel image on top of the background image instead.
</I>
Not sure it would work with alpha merging, unless you mean using
only the portion of the backgrpund which is going to be covered
for the alpha-merging, then drawing the merged panel on top
of the background. Got to see what out current Image class allows,
anyway I agree the method we're currently using is inefficient.

&gt;<i> Please comment and add your own.
</I>
All you wrote sounds reasonable to me, my only reccomendation
is to try keeping the codebase small.

And now, against my own reccomendation, a feature that I'd like
to add in the future: a context menu.

Some people have asked for buttons (ie shutdown / reboot), but I
think a right-click menu would be more efficient and spare us from
manually coding a three-state graphical button class.

I was thinking of something really simple as right-click everywhere to
pop-up a menu with the shutdown / reboot / exit / choose session,
not unlike the solaris login (without buttons).

This would also allow to shutdown / reboot without knowing the root
password or using ugly hacks.


That's all for now, I'm fiddling with NteBSD openpam, there is
some difference / incompatibiliy I'm investigating, ie 
lack of PAM_BAD_ITEM, PAM_FAIL_DELAY and pam_fail_delay()
