</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people really want this I think adding buttons is the better way.
</I>
I know, I'm the one who suggested the feature at first, anyway this was
just an idea for possible future features. If it were for me, well, I'm
quite happy with my keyboard ;-)

On a related note, I suggested menus instead of buttons also because I
pictured a *very* simple menu class with no/little customization,
i.e. just some color preference. Note that this means simpler themes too.

WRT other topics (widgets, cursors, scalable themes) I'm a bit reluctant
to take that road: as I explained before I'm personally satisfied of
what SLiM can do now. Sure, if we ever decide to give a feature bump
to the project, some major refactoring is definitely the way to go
as you suggest.

&gt;<i> &gt; Also, Xinerama is something which doesn't work correctly yet, and many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people would like; yet, I still don't have a setup ready... there's a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bug on berlios.de on that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately I don't have a multihead system, so I can't help with that
</I>&gt;<i> at the moment.
</I>
I think decent xinerama support should be a high priority activity
after 1.3 goes gold.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; Finally, I'd like if we'd get bug report and commit notifications to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this list. Unfortunately berlios.de was down right now, so I couldn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; check whether they make this easy or hard :-).
</I>
I moved the patches / bugs notification to this ML, will look what
can be done with commits.

&gt;<i> Speaking of bug-reports, we should probably go through the list soon.
</I>&gt;<i> Some of the reports are getting pretty old ^_^
</I>
True.

Regards,
Simone
