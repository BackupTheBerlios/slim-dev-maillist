<PRE>Hi,

&gt;&gt;<i> *) Add buttons or pop-up menu
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Some people have asked for buttons (ie shutdown / reboot), but I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> think a right-click menu would be more efficient and spare us from
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> manually coding a three-state graphical button class.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Actually I think buttons are easier to code than a menu AND it's easier
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to integrate in themes. I propose simply letting the themes supply the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> images in the tree states. It will also make the theme-makers happy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because I will allow them to make some nicely integrate buttons in their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> themes.
</I>&gt;<i> I think this is a nice idea; I personally would not add the
</I>&gt;<i> functionality at all since I think it's bloat in some ways, but since
</I>&gt;<i> people really want this I think adding buttons is the better way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just one thing:
</I>&gt;<i> We might also have to allow pixmap cursors; nothing ruins a theme
</I>&gt;<i> more easily than a boring mouse pointer :-). Martin, do you know how GDM
</I>&gt;<i> solves this (if at all)?
</I>
I can't recall if GDM changes the cursor or not, but I thing we should
be able to dig up some cursor code somewhere ^_^.

&gt;<i> It least set some cool cursor as default, if we don't want themers to
</I>&gt;<i> bother with this. I always loved the transparent one from qingy.
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://qingy.sourceforge.net/images/button_highlight.png">http://qingy.sourceforge.net/images/button_highlight.png</A>
</I>&gt;<i> (bottom right)
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder if this would be hard in X11...
</I>
It looks cool. I have no idea if that can be done with X11 cursors, but
we can always fake it if we really want that effect.

&gt;&gt;<i> Well, BEFORE doing anything (whether it be buttons or pop-up menu) I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> strongly suggest we split up Panel in widgets, because it's getting too
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bloated and there's too much book-keeping. I've been meaning to suggest
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that too, but I forgot that in my previous mail. This will also make it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easier to print messages (e.g. from PAM) without having to redraw the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whole screen to delete them again.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I thought about that too in the past, especially in the context of
</I>&gt;<i> themeing. What I always wanted to have was some more vector oriented way
</I>&gt;<i> to define themes; if you take the panel.png of the default theme for
</I>&gt;<i> example, it's just a fully transparent background with an image at a
</I>&gt;<i> certain position, and a rectangle with opaque black border filled with a
</I>&gt;<i> x% transparent white. Fiddling with the transparency values in gimp has
</I>&gt;<i> always annoyed me.
</I>
I've been wishing for something similar in a login manager, but I'm not
sure about whether that is the best way to go. The problem with vector
graphics is that either it gets too limited for the theme developers or
it gets very complex for the programmers. If we take a look at WMs and
widget-kits it also obvious that pixmap-engines are very popular because
theme-developers can get things just right.
I'm not completely against the idea, but I think we need a really good
design before implementing anything vector-based.
That said, we could think about make a few vector-based widgets
available as an addition to the pixmaps.....but let's see if we can get
the widgets working first.

&gt;<i> There's also a number of cool possibilities, like a load widget or a
</I>&gt;<i> clock widget... there could then be independent from the theme even.
</I>
Well, now we starting to talk bloat ^_^

&gt;<i> There's a certain danger to overdo and implement a much too complicated
</I>&gt;<i> widget system though, so I'd love to see some prototyping code for this
</I>&gt;<i> first.
</I>
Sure. I might give it a go sometime after the 1.3.0 release. My first
step would be simply to split Panel into smaller widget, giving us the
same functionally we have now.

&gt;<i> Also, Xinerama is something which doesn't work correctly yet, and many
</I>&gt;<i> people would like; yet, I still don't have a setup ready... there's a
</I>&gt;<i> bug on berlios.de on that.
</I>
Unfortunately I don't have a multihead system, so I can't help with that
at the moment.

&gt;<i> Finally, I'd like if we'd get bug report and commit notifications to
</I>&gt;<i> this list. Unfortunately berlios.de was down right now, so I couldn't
</I>&gt;<i> check whether they make this easy or hard :-).
</I>
Speaking of bug-reports, we should probably go through the list soon.
Some of the reports are getting pretty old ^_^
