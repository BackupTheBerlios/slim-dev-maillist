<PRE>Hey,

</I>
There's another argument, the fact that they're explicit (aka &quot;ugly&quot;
in Simone's terms :-)) and thus easy to find them using grep.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; *) We do duplicate calculations of font extend in several places in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;    panel.cpp. Either this should be done one time for all or, if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;    necessary, the calculation should be properly encapsulated.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; True; IMO a font class would be a step in the right direction,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so we can leave out the xft oddness from the main program logic.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree (though see below).
</I>Just as a sidenote, this is something we could probably copy/adjust
from a window manager, which often have such an abstraction class
for fonts already (I'm quite sure blackbox does for example).

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Please comment and add your own.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; All you wrote sounds reasonable to me, my only reccomendation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is to try keeping the codebase small.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree...small AND flexible.
</I>Let's just avoid adding features for the sake of having more of them.

&gt;<i> *) Add buttons or pop-up menu
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some people have asked for buttons (ie shutdown / reboot), but I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think a right-click menu would be more efficient and spare us from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; manually coding a three-state graphical button class.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually I think buttons are easier to code than a menu AND it's easier
</I>&gt;<i> to integrate in themes. I propose simply letting the themes supply the
</I>&gt;<i> images in the tree states. It will also make the theme-makers happy
</I>&gt;<i> because I will allow them to make some nicely integrate buttons in their
</I>&gt;<i> themes.
</I>I think this is a nice idea; I personally would not add the
functionality at all since I think it's bloat in some ways, but since
people really want this I think adding buttons is the better way.

Just one thing:
We might also have to allow pixmap cursors; nothing ruins a theme
more easily than a boring mouse pointer :-). Martin, do you know how GDM
solves this (if at all)?

It least set some cool cursor as default, if we don't want themers to
bother with this. I always loved the transparent one from qingy.

(bottom right)
I wonder if this would be hard in X11...


&gt;<i> Well, BEFORE doing anything (whether it be buttons or pop-up menu) I
</I>&gt;<i> strongly suggest we split up Panel in widgets, because it's getting too
</I>&gt;<i> bloated and there's too much book-keeping. I've been meaning to suggest
</I>&gt;<i> that too, but I forgot that in my previous mail. This will also make it
</I>&gt;<i> easier to print messages (e.g. from PAM) without having to redraw the
</I>&gt;<i> whole screen to delete them again.
</I>
I thought about that too in the past, especially in the context of
themeing. What I always wanted to have was some more vector oriented way
to define themes; if you take the panel.png of the default theme for
example, it's just a fully transparent background with an image at a
certain position, and a rectangle with opaque black border filled with a
x% transparent white. Fiddling with the transparency values in gimp has
always annoyed me.

There's also a number of cool possibilities, like a load widget or a
clock widget... there could then be independent from the theme even.

There's a certain danger to overdo and implement a much too complicated
widget system though, so I'd love to see some prototyping code for this
first.


Besides the vector themes, the only thing I'd really like to see changed
in slim is the restarting of the X server after logout; unfortunately,
I seriously lack the time to look into it.

Simone: Talking of themes, any news from xfce-looks.org regarding a SLiM
theme section?

Also, Xinerama is something which doesn't work correctly yet, and many
people would like; yet, I still don't have a setup ready... there's a
bug on berlios.de on that.


Finally, I'd like if we'd get bug report and commit notifications to
this list. Unfortunately berlios.de was down right now, so I couldn't
check whether they make this easy or hard :-).

Regards, Johannes
