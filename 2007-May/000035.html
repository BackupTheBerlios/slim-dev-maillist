<PRE>Hi,

&gt;&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think here we must decide if we're going the distributions way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rather than the slim way. What we do now, only using .xinitrc, is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> guaranteed to work almost everywhere.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I implemented it the way gentoo handels it. But I think other
</I>&gt;<i> distributions will do it in a similar way. I can take a look at some
</I>&gt;<i> other major distributions like suse, fedora and debian. btw the patch
</I>&gt;<i> does not disable the old way of session handling.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have no idea how much the use of the Sessions dir is spread across
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distributions and whether /path/Sessions/%session is always a script
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which plays well with slim everywhere.
</I>&gt;<i> In the script I check if the files in the paths are executable and if
</I>&gt;<i> there are none slim falls back to the old behaviour. (Reading the
</I>&gt;<i> session var).
</I>
I've looked the patch over and it's looks fine to me. I've taken the
liberty to make a few updates:
*) Fixed indention to match SLiM's
*) Removed bSuccess as we can simply check on session.empty(). IMHO it
makes the intent a bit clearer.

I've also tested it against the lastest revision (134) of the slim-pam
branch.

I've attached the updated patch as I don't have access to update the one
on the website.

&gt;&gt;<i> Any idea / comment on this? When in doubt, I prefer the current
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solution.
</I>&gt;<i> I prefer my patch ;-)
</I>
I like Bernhard's patch for now. I adds better support for those
distributions that support this, without breaking the rest. We might be
able to find a better solution later, especially since Xorg is trying to
standardize many of these issues, but until the distributions start
agreeing this seems like a reasonable solution.

&gt;<i> but I think there is still a &quot;bug&quot; since it
</I>&gt;<i> would be nice to save the session you started the last time in the home
</I>&gt;<i> directory of the user and restore it on the next login. It is somewhat
</I>&gt;<i> nasty to select the session every time.
</I>
Well, this is a whole other problem. We might think about fixing this
too, but if we start making major changes I suggest we start looking a
Xorg's standards.

Cheers,
