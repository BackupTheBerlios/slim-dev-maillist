<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> As we are now working on stabilizing SLiM for the 1.3.0 release and has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> closed for any more changes, I'm starting this list with ideas and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposals for later versions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *) Try to avoid C-style casts. slim currently have 104 C-style casts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    (not including the 10 in ssetbg). Some of these might be avoidable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    and most of the rest could probably be converted into C++ style
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    casts, which are safer and easier for the compiler to check.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    (<A HREF="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/bs_faq2.html#static-cast">http://www.research.att.com/~bs/bs_faq2.html#static-cast</A>)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/cplusplus/EXP00-A.+Do+not+use+C-style+casts">https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/cplusplus/EXP00-A.+Do+not+use+C-style+casts</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I partially agree. While there is little doubt that static casts are more
</I>&gt;<i> secure, I think it really makes sense when a piece of code becomes so
</I>&gt;<i> complicated that it's difficult to debug without some help from the
</I>&gt;<i> compiler.
</I>&gt;<i> That said, my only complain against C++ style casts is they're ugly
</I>&gt;<i> as hell to read, so I have no strong opinion on this.
</I>
That might actually be a good argument for using them as it will make
you avoid casts as much as possible ^_^.

&gt;&gt;<i> *) Switch from fork() to vfork() in app.cpp to avoid the memory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    overhead. vfork() is especially designed for the situation, when you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    combine fork() and exec() to execute another program. Using vfork()
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    have a smaller overhead but requires that we are a bit careful about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    what we do in the child process. Of course we also need to check if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    vfork() is available on all supported platforms.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    (<A HREF="http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/ForkExecProcesses.html">http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/ForkExecProcesses.html</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> AFAIK it's available in all of the BSDs.
</I>
Great!

&gt;&gt;<i> *) We do duplicate calculations of font extend in several places in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    panel.cpp. Either this should be done one time for all or, if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    necessary, the calculation should be properly encapsulated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> True; IMO a font class would be a step in the right direction,
</I>&gt;<i> so we can leave out the xft oddness from the main program logic.
</I>
I agree (though see below).

&gt;&gt;<i> *) In Image::Merge() we merge a (small) panel image with a (big)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    background image by reallocation a new (big) image, copy data from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    the two images and then free the two original images (the panel image
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    is freed in Image::Merge() and the background image is freed in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Panel::Panel()). It would be faster (and probably easier) to simply
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    draw the panel image on top of the background image instead.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure it would work with alpha merging, unless you mean using
</I>&gt;<i> only the portion of the backgrpund which is going to be covered
</I>&gt;<i> for the alpha-merging, then drawing the merged panel on top
</I>&gt;<i> of the background. Got to see what out current Image class allows,
</I>&gt;<i> anyway I agree the method we're currently using is inefficient.
</I>
The alpha of the background is ignored anyway, so all be need to do is
to take care of the alpha when drawing the panel on top of the
background. It should be a simple matter of restructuring: swap panel
and background in Panel::Panel(), remove the extra allocation, keep and
offset the part that combines pixel and remove the part that blindly
copies from the background.


&gt;&gt;<i> Please comment and add your own.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All you wrote sounds reasonable to me, my only reccomendation
</I>&gt;<i> is to try keeping the codebase small.
</I>
I agree...small AND flexible.


*) Add buttons or pop-up menu
&gt;<i> Some people have asked for buttons (ie shutdown / reboot), but I
</I>&gt;<i> think a right-click menu would be more efficient and spare us from
</I>&gt;<i> manually coding a three-state graphical button class.
</I>
Actually I think buttons are easier to code than a menu AND it's easier
to integrate in themes. I propose simply letting the themes supply the
images in the tree states. It will also make the theme-makers happy
because I will allow them to make some nicely integrate buttons in their
themes. This is similar to GDM btw. and I've always loved that faeture
in GDM (but not the dependency on Gnome ^_^).

&gt;<i> I was thinking of something really simple as right-click everywhere to
</I>&gt;<i> pop-up a menu with the shutdown / reboot / exit / choose session,
</I>&gt;<i> not unlike the solaris login (without buttons).
</I>
Well, BEFORE doing anything (whether it be buttons or pop-up menu) I
strongly suggest we split up Panel in widgets, because it's getting too
bloated and there's too much book-keeping. I've been meaning to suggest
that too, but I forgot that in my previous mail. This will also make it
easier to print messages (e.g. from PAM) without having to redraw the
whole screen to delete them again.

&gt;<i> This would also allow to shutdown / reboot without knowing the root
</I>&gt;<i> password or using ugly hacks.
</I>
That would be nice, yes.
