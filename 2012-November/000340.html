<PRE>Hi,

I've taken the liberty of forking SLiM for several reasons:

   - in my opinion an unacceptable level of maintainence.
   - long outstanding bugs.
   - general opinion of SLiM in the community.
   - because I seemingly have nothing better to do.

I really like SLiM and I use it on all systems that I have owing to SLiM's
simplicity and ease of use. Also, compared to the *ahem* opposition SLiM
has relatively few dependencies. It's simplicity means that I would hate
for it to fall to the wayside and become unkempt or suffer from bitrot.

My fork is a take-it-or-leave-it fork. I am not attempting to 'steal' the
repo away or anything like that. Hopefully it'll be a reminder about some
outstanding issues and we can get going again with the development. Going
forward I am fine with having my changes merged upstream or having patches
sent to me.

The issues I primarily have in mind are:

   - i18n issues, some of which I have hopefully already addressed.
   - Compatibility with systemd.
   - Code quality (modern idioms, standards, available classes).
   - Internal code documentation (X is a scary place to be and undocumented
   X code is practically hell.)

Finally, I have converted the repo from SVN to git and hosted the code on
GitHub primarily because GitHub is about a million more times accessible
than anything else I have used and also that Git is simply a better VCS
tool than SVN. The downside to this is that there are extremely useful bug
reports, patch requests and other comments on the Berlios site. If someone
has a way to port them across it'd be useful. Otherwise I will just make an
issue on the GitHub page to link to the Bug Reports on the Berlios one.

Here is the link to the repository: <A HREF="https://github.com/AeroNotix/slim-git">https://github.com/AeroNotix/slim-git</A>

Much appreciated,
Aaron
