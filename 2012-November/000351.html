<PRE>Hi,

First, thank you for your work.
I can not take time about this.
I applied the patch which had accumulated at hand to the repository.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've taken the liberty of forking SLiM for several reasons:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> in my opinion an unacceptable level of maintainence.
</I>&gt;<i> long outstanding bugs.
</I>&gt;<i> general opinion of SLiM in the community.
</I>&gt;<i> because I seemingly have nothing better to do.

I have not received mail of project participation from you.
Fork is easy.
However, I consider that it is better to send mail of a project
participating request.

If you want to be project member, please apply.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I really like SLiM and I use it on all systems that I have owing to SLiM's
</I>&gt;<i> simplicity and ease of use. Also, compared to the *ahem* opposition SLiM has
</I>&gt;<i> relatively few dependencies. It's simplicity means that I would hate for it
</I>&gt;<i> to fall to the wayside and become unkempt or suffer from bitrot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My fork is a take-it-or-leave-it fork. I am not attempting to 'steal' the
</I>&gt;<i> repo away or anything like that. Hopefully it'll be a reminder about some
</I>&gt;<i> outstanding issues and we can get going again with the development. Going
</I>&gt;<i> forward I am fine with having my changes merged upstream or having patches
</I>&gt;<i> sent to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The issues I primarily have in mind are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i18n issues, some of which I have hopefully already addressed.
</I>&gt;<i> Compatibility with systemd.
</I>&gt;<i> Code quality (modern idioms, standards, available classes).
</I>&gt;<i> Internal code documentation (X is a scary place to be and undocumented X
</I>&gt;<i> code is practically hell.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, I have converted the repo from SVN to git and hosted the code on
</I>&gt;<i> GitHub primarily because GitHub is about a million more times accessible
</I>&gt;<i> than anything else I have used and also that Git is simply a better VCS tool
</I>&gt;<i> than SVN. The downside to this is that there are extremely useful bug
</I>&gt;<i> reports, patch requests and other comments on the Berlios site. If someone
</I>&gt;<i> has a way to port them across it'd be useful. Otherwise I will just make an
</I>&gt;<i> issue on the GitHub page to link to the Bug Reports on the Berlios one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is the link to the repository: <A HREF="https://github.com/AeroNotix/slim-git">https://github.com/AeroNotix/slim-git</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
BTW, I pushed my queue to SVN (I am using git-svn).
Of cause, I can change to Git on Berlios.

Best regards,
  Nobuhiro
