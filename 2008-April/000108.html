In the past, we've talked about both mouse support as well as
something like &quot;widgets&quot; to implement the graphical elements in a more
flexible way than they are now. As far as I know, there's currently no
active development in this area, but that doesn't mean that we're
opposed to this :-).

That said this may be a major rework of some part of SLiM, so it
shouldn't be underestimated. I'm fairly sure that the particular
feature you want could be done more easily without adapting the rest
of the code, but for me this could only serve as a first impression
how it should look like, not as a final/official implementation.

While this list is fairly quiet, it's definitely the right place to
discuss such ideas, so if please feel free to elaborate on your ideas
and plans!

Regards, Johannes
