Hi Johannes,

Thanks for this detail :).

&gt;<i>  That said this may be a major rework of some part of SLiM, so it
</I>&gt;<i>  shouldn't be underestimated. I'm fairly sure that the particular
</I>&gt;<i>  feature you want could be done more easily without adapting the rest
</I>&gt;<i>  of the code, but for me this could only serve as a first impression
</I>&gt;<i>  how it should look like, not as a final/official implementation.
</I>
My first feeling about the way to do it is to study the current code
deeply, then implement a personal patch... I have no view to an
official release and don't really mind. I read many guys that complain
about these lacks on the web, so it could be nice to share the patch
in the end, but it is very early to deal with that point.

I asked the list to know whether current development was working on
the issue or not. Now, I know I can start. My aim is to respect the
true nature of slim: very light, modular, easy conf file...


&gt;<i>  While this list is fairly quiet, it's definitely the right place to
</I>&gt;<i>  discuss such ideas, so if please feel free to elaborate on your ideas
</I>&gt;<i>  and plans!
</I>
I will share my plans, the issues, and so on with the list all along
the way. And it will be a pleasure to read your comments, advice, and
criticism. Feel free to share !
I don't consider myself as a guru, and I am sure that I will have a
lot of questions soon.

Well, I am going to study the current code and ask the list for any
misunderstood point.


Gal'
