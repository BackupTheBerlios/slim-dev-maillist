<PRE>Bug #14289, was updated on 2008-Jul-31 14:26
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: SLiM
Category: None
Status: Closed
Resolution: Fixed
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5
Submitted by: cyberpatrol
Assigned to : none
Summary: SLiM can't handle logins with secure passwords

Details: SLiM can't handle logins with secure passwords.

I've just installed SLiM and tried to login. Instead of logging into my DE, it just beeped and reloaded its login screen again.

After changing my users' passwords to the far too short and far too insecure password &quot;testpw&quot;, SLiM logged me into my DE.

So I think, that the password field/variable is far too short and/or doesn't accept every possible character.

The password field/variable and/or its content should not be limited in any way. This needs urgently be fixed.

Okay, that explains it. There was a typo in the code (the wrong constant was used), the original author of this code actually set 50 as limit for passwords.

I've committed a fix for that. 

According to getpass(3), the limit is BUFSIZE on glibc systems. I'll see whether that can be changed easily

Comment:
It should not be limited in any way. Maybe there are some people, who are using even longer passwords.

If this must be limited, then I'd suggest to limit it to at least 50 characters.

I'm not sure, if the password field on the text console is limited. But SLiM's password field should be able to handle exact the same passwords which can be handled by the login on the text console.

Comment:
Try it with a randomly generated password with 36 characters or more, which contains letters, digits and special characters.

Use e.g. `pwgen -c -n -s -y 36` to create one.

Comment:
Okay, I misread that, there's a 30 character limit. is that &quot;far too short&quot;?

Hi,

There's no arbitrary limit for password length in SLiM, and I have no problem using special characters.

Please provide a password that exposes the problem
