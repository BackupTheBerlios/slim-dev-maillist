Summary: Keyboard becomes unusable in tty from which slim is lauched

Details: Hi,

I have slim starting a daemon from TTY1 on boot-up. If, after logging into my X session, I try to use TTY1 for cli programs, I basically can't because the keyboard becomes slower and slower: I have to wait for hours between each key press or they are simply ignored. 

Looks like this problem has already been observed by other people, according to the following bug in the Debian BTS : 
<A HREF="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=475249">http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=475249</A>

I appreciate very much slim, it's exactly the king of login managr I was looking for since a while, but this bug serioulsy makes me consider switching back to good old startx...

No. After a manually start the ttys are working correct.

Hmm. What could be the problem in that case?

Comment:
does the problem persist if slim is manually invoked as 'slim -d' from a tty?

Comment:
I have the same problem und my LFS with slim &lt;= 1.3.1.

slim was builded without pam.

After slim was started by init I must press a key two times to get a response on any tty.

Hi,

I am using slim on ArchLinux, and here in arch slim is compiled without PAM, so it is not the source of problem. 

/etc/slim.conf contains the default 'login_cmd' line:
login_cmd exec /bin/bash -login ~/.xinitrc %session 

I ve also commented all OpenLog() and CloseLog() calls from app.cpp but problem with keyboard on tty1 (or any other tty from which slim starts) remains.

Comment:
After some additional test, the problem is related to what /etc/X11/XSession (or related files) do.

putting the default:
login_cmd           exec /bin/bash -login ~/.xinitrc %session

in /etc/slim.conf and using a simple xinitrc as included in the source package seems to work here: tty1 responds normally. You can also use something like

login_cmd           exec /bin/bash -login /etc/slim.sessions %session

for a globally available session file.

Bug seems still present on debian with PAM and logging disabled.

Comment:
Can you please try to compile slim without PAM support and see
if the problem persists? I cannot reproduce the error and I don't have a PAM-enabled system at hand right now.

Another thing you may want to try is to comment all OpenLog() and CloseLog() calls from app.cpp.

Meanwhile I'll try to install debian/unstable on a test machine
